# California Housing Affordability Optimization Project

## **Overview**
This project explores **housing affordability in California** by integrating **predictive modeling** and **optimization techniques**. The objective is to provide **data-driven insights** and **optimal housing recommendations** for policymakers, city planners, and individuals.

This work is part of **IEOR 240 (Optimization Analysis) and IEOR 242A (Machine Learning Analytics)** at **UC Berkeley**, demonstrating the intersection of **machine learning** and **optimization-based decision-making** in real-world housing challenges.

---

## **Motivation**
California faces a **severe housing affordability crisis**, where housing costs significantly outpace income growth. This project aims to:
- **Predict housing costs** based on historical trends and socio-economic indicators.
- **Optimize housing selection** by balancing affordability, location, and quality of life.
- **Support decision-making** for policymakers and individuals navigating the housing market.

## **Objectives**
1. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Develop machine learning models (e.g., **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting**) to forecast **home prices** and **rental costs**.  
   - Identify key drivers of affordability using feature importance analysis.

2. **Optimization Framework**  
   - Formulate an **optimization model** to recommend the **best affordable housing options** based on income, location, and amenities.  
   - Use **constraint-based optimization** to maximize **Quality of Life (QoL)** metrics while ensuring affordability.  
   - Compare **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** with **heuristic algorithms** for scalable solutions.

3. **Scenario Analysis & Policy Impact**  
   - Test **different affordability scenarios** under varying income distributions.  
   - Analyze the impact of **zoning policies and rent control measures** on affordability.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Processing** (📂 `/src/data_processing.py`)  
   - Cleans & merges housing, economic, and demographic data.  
   - Produces **two datasets**:  
     - 📄 **`ml_data.csv`** → For predictive modeling (house-level data).  
     - 📄 **`optimization_data.csv`** → For metro-wide yearly optimization.

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline** (📂 `/src/ml_model.py`)  
   - Trains **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Regression models**.  
   - Evaluates affordability prediction accuracy.

3. **Optimization Model** (📂 `/src/optimization.py`)  
   - Constructs a **Quality of Life (QoL) function** based on affordability, safety, and convenience.  
   - Runs **constrained optimization** to **recommend optimal locations**.
